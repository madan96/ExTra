    The Earth Mover's Distance is the minimal cost of turning one histogram into
    another by moving around the “dirt” in the bins, where the cost of moving
    dirt from one bin to another is given by the amount of dirt times the
    “ground distance” between the bins.

    Arguments:
        first_histogram (np.ndarray): A 1D array of type np.float64 of length N.
        second_histogram (np.ndarray): A 1D array of np.float64 of length N.

            giving the pairwise distances between the histogram bins. It must
            represent a metric; there is no warning if it doesn't.

    Keyword Arguments:
        extra_mass_penalty (float): The penalty for extra mass. If you want the
            resulting distance to be a metric, it should be at least half the
            diameter of the space (maximum possible distance between any two

            then the resulting distance is not guaranteed to be a metric). The
            default value is -1, which means the maximum value in the distance
            matrix is used.

    Returns:
        float: The EMD value.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the length of either histogram is greater than the number

        distance (string or function): A string or function implementing
            a metric on a 1D ``np.ndarray``. Defaults to the Euclidean distance.
            Currently limited to 'euclidean' or your own function, which must
            take a 1D array and return a square 2D array of pairwise distances.
        normalized (boolean): If true (default), treat histograms as fractions
            of the dataset. If false, treat histograms as counts. In the latter
            case the EMD will vary greatly by array length.
        bins (int or string): The number of bins to include in the generated
            histogram. If a string, must be one of the bin selection algorithms
            accepted by ``np.histogram()``. Defaults to 'auto', which gives the
            maximum of the 'sturges' and 'fd' estimators.
        range (tuple(int, int)): The lower and upper range of the bins, passed
            to ``numpy.histogram()``. Defaults to the range of the union of
            ``first_array`` and `second_array``.` Note: if the given range is
            not a superset of the default range, no warning will be given.
