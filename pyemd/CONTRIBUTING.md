Installation issues
===================

Before opening an issue related to installation, please try to install PyEMD in
a fresh, empty Python virtual environment and check that the problem persists:

```shell
pip install virtualenvwrapper
mkvirtualenv pyemd
pip install pyemd
```

PyEMD is not officially supported for (but may nonetheless work with) the following:

- Anaconda distributions
- Windows operating systems

However, if you need to use it in these cases, pull requests are welcome!
